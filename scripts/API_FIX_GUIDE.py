🚨 URGENT: API TOKEN FIX GUIDE
==============================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Both your API tokens (demo and live) are returning HTTP 401 errors.
This means the tokens are either:
1. Invalid/expired
2. Don't have proper permissions
3. Account verification issues

IMMEDIATE SOLUTION STEPS:
========================

STEP 1: Create New API Tokens
-----------------------------
1. Go to: https://app.deriv.com
2. Log into your account
3. Click on "Settings" or profile menu
4. Find "API Token" section
5. DELETE all existing tokens
6. Create NEW tokens with these EXACT settings:

   FOR DEMO TOKEN:
   ✅ Name: "Demo Trading Bot"
   ✅ Scopes: SELECT ALL OF THESE:
      - ✅ Read (mandatory)
      - ✅ Trade (CRITICAL - needed for placing trades)
      - ✅ Trading information (recommended)
      - ✅ Payments (optional)
      - ✅ Admin (recommended for full access)
   
   FOR LIVE TOKEN (if you want real trading):
   ✅ Name: "Live Trading Bot"
   ✅ Scopes: Same as above
   ⚠️ WARNING: Live token trades with real money!

STEP 2: Update Configuration
---------------------------
1. Copy the NEW tokens exactly (no spaces)
2. Update the tokens in config.py:

# Replace these lines in config.py:
DERIV_LIVE_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_NEW_LIVE_TOKEN_HERE"
DERIV_DEMO_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_NEW_DEMO_TOKEN_HERE"

STEP 3: Verify Account Requirements
----------------------------------
✅ Account must be VERIFIED (check email for verification links)
✅ Account must have positive balance (even demo needs small amount)
✅ No country restrictions for your location
✅ Account not suspended or restricted

STEP 4: Test the Fix
-------------------
After updating tokens, run:
python fix_api.py

COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:
=========================

❌ "InvalidToken" Error:
   → Token copied incorrectly (check for extra spaces)
   → Token expired or revoked
   → Wrong account type

❌ "InsufficientScope" Error:
   → Token missing 'Trade' permission
   → Recreate token with ALL permissions

❌ "Unauthorized" Error:

❌ Still getting HTTP 401:
   → Wait 5-10 minutes after creating new tokens

   → Clear browser cache
   → Try different browser
