# üîë GET YOUR MT5 DEMO ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS

## Why Do You Need These?

2. **Check your current login**:
   - Go to "Tools" ‚Üí "Options" ‚Üí "Server" tab
   - Your login number and server will be displayed
3. **Use those credentials** in config.py

### Option 2: Create New Deriv Demo Account (Recommended)
1. **Go to** https://deriv.com/
2. **Click "Try Demo"** or "Demo Account"
3. **Sign up** for free demo account
4. **Download MT5** from Deriv
5. **Login with** the credentials they provide
6. **Copy credentials** to config.py

### Option 3: Other Brokers (MetaQuotes, ICMarkets, etc.)
1. Visit broker website
2. Click "Demo Account" 
3. Fill registration form
4. Download their MT5 platform
5. Use provided login credentials

## üìù Update Your Config:

Open `config.py` and update these lines:

```python
# Replace these with YOUR actual credentials:
MT5_LOGIN = 5020568354  # ‚Üê Your demo account number
MT5_PASSWORD = "demopassword123"  # ‚Üê Your demo password  
MT5_SERVER = "Deriv-Demo"  # ‚Üê Your broker's server
```

## Common Server Names:
