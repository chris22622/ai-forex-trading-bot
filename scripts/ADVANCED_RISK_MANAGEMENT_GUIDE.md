## ⚙️ **Configuration Settings**

In `config.py`, you can adjust these settings:

```python
# 🚨 ADVANCED RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
ENABLE_SMART_RISK_MANAGEMENT = True   # Enable/disable system
MAX_LOSS_PER_TRADE = 2.50            # Close trades losing > $2.50
MAX_PORTFOLIO_LOSS = 15.0             # Emergency close all if total loss > $15
MAX_TRADE_AGE_MINUTES = 30            # Close trades older than 30 minutes
RISK_CHECK_INTERVAL = 30              # Check every 30 seconds
```

### **Recommended Settings by Risk Level:**

#### Conservative (Safer)
```python
MAX_LOSS_PER_TRADE = 1.50            # Close at $1.50 loss
MAX_PORTFOLIO_LOSS = 10.0             # Emergency at $10 total loss
MAX_TRADE_AGE_MINUTES = 15            # Close after 15 minutes
```

#### Moderate (Default)
```python
MAX_LOSS_PER_TRADE = 2.50            # Close at $2.50 loss
MAX_PORTFOLIO_LOSS = 15.0             # Emergency at $15 total loss
MAX_TRADE_AGE_MINUTES = 30            # Close after 30 minutes
```

#### Aggressive (Higher Risk)
```python
MAX_LOSS_PER_TRADE = 4.00            # Close at $4.00 loss
MAX_PORTFOLIO_LOSS = 25.0             # Emergency at $25 total loss
MAX_TRADE_AGE_MINUTES = 45            # Close after 45 minutes
```

## 🛠️ **Manual Risk Management Tools**

### Using the Risk Management Tools
Run the advanced risk management script:
```bash
python risk_management_tools.py
```

### Available Tools:
1. **📊 Check Current Trades** - See all active positions with P&L
2. **🚨 Close Heavy Losers** - Close trades losing more than $2.00
3. **🔴 Close ALL Losing Trades** - Emergency close all losing positions
4. **💰 Close Profitable Trades** - Lock in all current profits
5. **🛠️ Custom Loss Threshold** - Set your own loss limit

### Quick Commands (while bot is running):
```python
# Check all current trades
await debug_current_trades()

# Close trades losing more than $2.00
await close_heavy_losers(2.0)

# Emergency close all losing trades
await close_all_losing_trades()

# Lock in all current profits
await close_profitable_trades()
```

## 📊 **Risk Management Statistics**

The system tracks important statistics:
- **Total trades auto-closed**: How many trades the system has closed
- **Total loss saved**: How much money the system has saved you
- **Last cleanup time**: When the system last took action

These stats are logged regularly and help you understand the system's effectiveness.

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **1. Regular Monitoring**
- Check the risk management logs regularly
- Review which trades are being closed and why
- Adjust settings based on your risk tolerance

### **2. Position Sizing**
- Use appropriate position sizes for your account
- Smaller positions = less risk per trade
- The system works better with proper sizing

### **3. Market Conditions**
- In volatile markets, consider tighter loss limits
- In trending markets, you might allow wider stops
- Adjust `MAX_TRADE_AGE_MINUTES` based on market speed

### **4. Profit Taking**
- Use the manual tools to lock in profits periodically
- Don't let all profits turn into losses
- The system protects losses, but you manage profits

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **System Behavior**
- The system only closes **losing** trades automatically
- Profitable trades are left alone to maximize gains
- Emergency protection closes all losing trades if portfolio risk is too high

### **Manual Override**
- You can always close trades manually if needed
- The system doesn't prevent you from managing positions
- Use the risk management tools for quick actions

### **Integration with Profit Protection**
- Works alongside the Profit Protection system
- Risk management prevents losses, profit protection locks gains
- Together they provide comprehensive account protection

## 🚨 **Emergency Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Market Crash**
If the market moves strongly against you:
1. The system will automatically close losing trades
2. Portfolio protection will trigger if total loss is too high
3. You'll receive immediate notifications
4. Bot continues trading with remaining capital

### **Scenario 2: Network Issues**
If you lose connection:
1. Trades remain open in MT5
2. When connection resumes, the system checks all positions
3. Risk management rules are applied to current status
4. Old trades are closed if they exceed age limits

### **Scenario 3: System Overrides**
If you need to manually intervene:
1. Use `risk_management_tools.py` for quick actions
2. Close specific types of trades (losing, profitable, old)
3. Override system decisions when needed
4. System will resume normal operation after manual actions

## 📈 **Performance Impact**

### **Capital Preservation**
- Prevents small losses from becoming large ones
- Keeps drawdowns manageable
- Preserves capital for future opportunities

### **Trading Psychology**
- Reduces stress from watching losing trades
- Automates difficult closing decisions
- Allows focus on strategy rather than individual trades

### **Account Growth**
- Controlled risk leads to steadier growth
- Prevents account blowups
- Maintains consistent trading capital

---

**Remember**: This system is designed to protect your capital while allowing profitable trades to run. It's a safety net, not a profit maximizer. Use it alongside good trading practices and proper position sizing for best results.
