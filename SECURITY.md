## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Account Security
- **Never share your MT5 credentials** in configuration files or logs
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Enable two-factor authentication** on your MT5 and broker accounts
- **Regularly rotate passwords** and API keys
- **Monitor account activity** regularly for unauthorized access

#### Trading Security
- **Start with demo accounts** before using real money
- **Set strict position limits** to prevent catastrophic losses
- **Implement stop-loss mechanisms** on all trades
- **Monitor bot behavior** and be prepared to intervene
- **Keep trading capital separate** from your main accounts

#### System Security
- **Keep your system updated** with the latest security patches
- **Use antivirus software** and keep it updated
- **Secure your network connection** when trading
- **Regular backups** of your configuration and trading data
- **Isolate trading systems** from other activities when possible

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Dependency management**: Keep dependencies updated and audit them regularly
- **Secret management**: Never commit secrets; use environment variables
- **Logging security**: Don't log sensitive information
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

#### API Security
- **Rate limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for API calls
- **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
- **Access control**: Implement proper access controls and permissions

## üîê Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Sensitive data is loaded from environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All examples use placeholder values
- **Input Validation**: Basic input validation for trading parameters
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without exposing sensitive details
- **Logging**: Careful logging that doesn't expose credentials

### Planned Security Enhancements

- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt local configuration files
- **API Key Rotation**: Automatic API key rotation capabilities
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all trading activities
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detection of unusual trading patterns
- **Secure Communication**: Enhanced encryption for all external communications

## üö´ Known Security Considerations

### Trading Risks
- **Market Risk**: Sudden market movements can cause significant losses
- **System Risk**: Technical failures can impact trading performance
- **Liquidity Risk**: Inability to exit positions during volatile periods
- **Execution Risk**: Delays in order execution can affect profitability

### Technical Risks
- **Network Connectivity**: Internet outages can prevent trading operations
- **Platform Dependency**: Reliance on MetaTrader 5 platform availability
- **Third-party APIs**: Dependency on external services and their reliability
- **Local System**: Hardware failures or system crashes
