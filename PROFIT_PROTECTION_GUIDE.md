# üõ°Ô∏è PROFIT PROTECTION SYSTEM GUIDE

## What is Profit Protection?

The Profit Protection System is a safety mechanism that automatically stops the trading bot when your account reaches a target profit level. This prevents you from losing gains due to market volatility or bad trades after making good profits.

## How It Works

### Automatic Triggers
- **Warning at 80%**: When you reach 80% of your target ($8 out of $10), you'll get a warning
- **Stop at Target**: When you reach your target profit ($10), the bot stops trading automatically  
- **Emergency Stop**: If somehow you reach $15 profit, emergency stop is triggered

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Detection**: Monitors your balance every minute
- ‚úÖ **Telegram Notifications**: Sends alerts when protection triggers
- ‚úÖ **Manual Override**: You can reset and resume trading if desired
- ‚úÖ **Profit Tracking**: Tracks total profit from your starting balance

## Configuration

The system is configured in `config.py`:

```python
# üõ°Ô∏è PROFIT PROTECTION SYSTEM  
PROFIT_PROTECTION_ENABLED = True      # Enable/disable the system
PROFIT_PROTECTION_THRESHOLD = 10.0    # Stop at $10 profit
PROFIT_PROTECTION_MAX_THRESHOLD = 15.0  # Emergency stop at $15
```

## What Happens When Triggered?

1. **Bot Stops Trading**: No new trades will be placed
2. **Notification Sent**: You receive a Telegram message with details
3. **Positions Remain Open**: Your existing trades continue (not closed automatically)
4. **Manual Action Required**: You decide what to do next

## Recommended Actions When Protection Triggers

### Step 1: Check Your Positions
- Log into your MT5 terminal
- Review all open positions
- Check which ones are profitable

### Step 2: Lock In Profits
- Close profitable positions manually
- Consider leaving some positions if they have strong momentum
- Take screenshots of your profits for records

### Step 3: Decide Next Steps
- **Option A**: Withdraw some profits and resume with smaller balance
- **Option B**: Reset protection and continue with same balance  
- **Option C**: Stop trading for the day and enjoy your gains

## Managing the System

### Using the Manager Script
Run the profit protection manager:
```bash
python profit_protection_manager.py
```

### Manual Commands (while bot is running)
In Python console:
```python
# Check status
from main import check_profit_protection_status
check_profit_protection_status()

# Reset protection (resume trading)  
from main import reset_profit_protection_manual
reset_profit_protection_manual()
```

## Customizing Protection Levels

You can adjust the protection levels in `config.py`:

### Conservative (Safer)
```python
PROFIT_PROTECTION_THRESHOLD = 5.0     # Stop at $5 profit
PROFIT_PROTECTION_MAX_THRESHOLD = 8.0  # Emergency at $8
```

### Moderate (Default)
```python
PROFIT_PROTECTION_THRESHOLD = 10.0    # Stop at $10 profit
PROFIT_PROTECTION_MAX_THRESHOLD = 15.0  # Emergency at $15
```

### Aggressive (Higher Risk)
```python
PROFIT_PROTECTION_THRESHOLD = 20.0    # Stop at $20 profit
PROFIT_PROTECTION_MAX_THRESHOLD = 25.0  # Emergency at $25
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **The system tracks profit from your STARTING balance when the bot was launched**

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you restart the bot, it resets the starting balance to current balance**

‚ö†Ô∏è **The system doesn't automatically close positions - you do that manually**

‚ö†Ô∏è **You can disable the system by setting `PROFIT_PROTECTION_ENABLED = False`**

## Example Scenario

1. **Start**: Bot launches with $100 balance
2. **Trading**: Bot makes several successful trades  
3. **Balance**: Account grows to $108
4. **Warning**: "80% of target reached" notification
5. **Target Hit**: Balance reaches $110 - bot stops trading
6. **Action**: You manually close profitable positions
7. **Result**: You've locked in $10+ profit safely!

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Trade After Restart
- Check if profit protection was triggered before shutdown
- Use the manager script to check status
- Reset protection if needed

### Wrong Starting Balance
- The starting balance is set when bot first connects to MT5
- If you added/withdrew money, restart the bot or reset protection

### System Not Working
- Check `config.py` has `PROFIT_PROTECTION_ENABLED = True`
- Verify Telegram notifications are working
- Check the bot logs for error messages

**Remember**: This system is designed to protect your profits, not to maximize them. It's better to lock in consistent smaller gains than to risk losing everything on a bad streak!
