# MT5 Symbol Info Warnings - ISSUE RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
The bot was showing warnings like:
```
[WARNING] Missing or invalid volume_min for Volatility 75 Index, using default: 0.01
[WARNING] Missing or invalid volume_max for Volatility 75 Index, using default: 100.0
[WARNING] Missing or invalid volume_step for Volatility 75 Index, using default: 0.01
[WARNING] Missing or invalid digits for Volatility 75 Index, using default: 5
[WARNING] Missing or invalid trade_contract_size for Volatility 75 Index, using default: 100000
```

## Root Cause
**Duplicate `get_symbol_info()` methods** in `mt5_integration.py`:
1. **First method** (line ~211): Correctly implemented with proper validation and field names
2. **Second method** (line ~536): **DUPLICATE** using different field names (`min_lot`, `max_lot` instead of `volume_min`, `volume_max`)

The second method was overriding the first one, causing the validation method to receive the wrong field names.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Method
- Deleted the duplicate `get_symbol_info()` method at line 536
- This method was using incompatible field names that caused validation failures

### 2. Cleared Python Cache
- Removed `__pycache__` directory to eliminate cached bytecode from old duplicate method
- This ensured the corrected code was being used

### 3. Verified Real Symbol Data
The symbols **ARE available** and working correctly:

**Volatility 75 Index:**
- volume_min: 0.001
- volume_max: 5.0  
- volume_step: 0.001
- digits: 2
- contract_size: 1.0

**Volatility 100 Index:**
- volume_min: 0.5
- volume_max: 200.0
- volume_step: 0.01
- digits: 2  
- contract_size: 1.0

## Verification Tests

### ✅ Symbol Info Retrieval
- Both symbols return valid data without warnings
- All required fields are present and correctly typed

### ✅ Lot Size Calculations  
- $10 → Volatility 75: 0.010 lots, Volatility 100: 0.500 lots
- $25 → Volatility 75: 0.025 lots, Volatility 100: 0.500 lots
- $50 → Volatility 75: 0.050 lots, Volatility 100: 0.500 lots

### ✅ Validation Logic
- `_validate_symbol_info()` method working correctly
- No fallback to default values needed
- Real MT5 symbol specifications being used

## Status: ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED

**No more warnings!** The MT5 integration now correctly:
- Retrieves real symbol information from MT5
- Uses proper field names throughout the validation chain  
- Calculates accurate lot sizes based on actual symbol specifications
- Eliminates all "Missing or invalid" warnings

The duplicate method issue has been eliminated and the bot now operates with clean, warning-free MT5 symbol handling.

## Files Modified
- `mt5_integration.py`: Removed duplicate `get_symbol_info()` method
- Cleared `__pycache__/` directory

## Prevention
The codebase now has a single, properly implemented `get_symbol_info()` method that correctly interfaces with the validation system.
